## Complicated vs. Complex 

- reminds me of [Simple Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey
- complex societies consume more energy
- hunter gatherer vs. today

## Why become more complex?
- to help solve problems
- energy complexity spiral--becoming more complex requires more energy
- currently, complexity appears to be free because we pay for it via fossil fuels
- collapse happens due to declining marginal returns from complexity and its cost increase

### Historic Example
- Byzantine Empire simplified into a soft landing due to outside (Arabian) forces--deprived the Byzantineâ€™s of revenue from taxes.

Soft landing from:
1. reduced the size of the army
2. many cities abandoned 


- Sustainability = Energy + Innovation
- All easy innovations have been achieved and is now more complicated (based at number of patents and people involved per patent).
