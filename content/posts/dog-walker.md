# 🐕 Lake Eola Dog Walkers: Professional Dog Walking Service

Now that the [email collection](https://email.collection.email/) application is running, I created [Lake Eola Dog Walkers](https://eoladogwalkers.com/) as a first application.

---

## 1. 🧠 The Idea

This seems like a good first application. There is only one other dog walking service in the area. A good goal to keep motivation is to create something out of the gate that can generate income.

---

## 2. 👥 Who It’s For

This service if for people who want/need someone to walk their dog.

---

## 3. 🔍 Research & Competitors

### Existing services:

- [Eola Pets](https://www.eolapets.com/)


---

## 4. ⚙️ How It Works

You pay me money, I walk your dog around Lake Eola.

---

## 5. 🤖 Tech Stack


### Built as a static HTML page


- The app is hosted in a S3 bucket.


---

## 6. Learnings

- With the right prompt, Claude can churn out a nice website.


---

## 7. Next Steps

Get a customer.

---

## 8. 🌐 Follow My Projects

This is my my second of 20 experiments I’m building for a “20-app challenge.” I want to create and release 20 small tools to learn what developers want, what sticks, and what solves real problems.
