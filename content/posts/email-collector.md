# üì¨ email\_collector: A Privacy-First Email Signup Backend for Developers

**Posted on [iacut.one/software.html](https://iacut.one/software.html)**

---

## 1. üß† The Idea

Most email collection tools‚Äîlike MailChimp or ConvertKit‚Äîrequire:

* Embedding third-party JavaScript
* Accepting branding or limited free tiers
* Surrendering user data to centralized platforms

My app is a dead-simple REST API for collecting and retrieving email signups, built with privacy and developer control in mind.

---

## 2. üë• Who It‚Äôs For

**email\_collector** is designed for:

* Indie hackers launching landing pages
* Developers tired of heavy integrations
* Privacy-conscious teams who want to own their data

No JavaScript. No trackers. Just POST to an endpoint and GET back email signups later.

### What I wanted:

* No dependencies
* Generous campaign/email limits
* Limited data collection
* No branding on my website

---

## 4. ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### POST endpoint for collecting emails:

```http
POST /api/collect
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "campaign": "launch"
}
```

### GET endpoint to retrieve signups:

```http
GET /api/emails?campaign=launch
```

This makes it easy to:

* Drop a form into your site with a simple HTML form
* Collect emails per campaign (e.g. "launch", "waitlist", "beta")
* Pull signups as a CSV or from the aforementioned GET endpoint

## 5. ü§ñ Building It with an LLM-Powered Phoenix Workflow

While this app is relatively simple, I wanted to try something different: **vibe coding with [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/)**, an AI-first code editor.

The result was surprisingly productive:

* The LLM scaffolded a basic **Phoenix API** with routing and plug-based validation
* It helped with edge cases, like ensuring emails were valid before insertion
* Even small touches‚Äîlike timestamped logs or JSON responses‚Äîwere quickly refined through iterative prompting

This made building the API **feel like collaborating with an assistant**, not just writing code solo.

## 6. Learnings

I used the Claude Sonnet 4.0 context window to vibe code the application. The following are brief issues I had while vibe coding:

- Could not figure out how to refactor the flash message in a desirable manner
- Generated css stylings in the HTML templates
- Made all CSS tailwind specific
- Made very weird decision with the Phoenix form helpers

---

## 7. Next Steps

Now I have an operational email collection app, I can easily collect emails on splash pages without the worries of using the current email collections providers. I plan on starting my next app using my email collections service, [Eola Dog Walkers](https://eoladogwalkers.com).

## 8. üåê Follow My Projects

This is my first of many experiments I‚Äôm building under a ‚Äú20-app challenge.‚Äù I want to create and release 20 small tools to learn what developers want, what sticks, and what solves real problems.

- https://collection.email or https://email-collection.com -- I am unsure which domain will be best for SEO
