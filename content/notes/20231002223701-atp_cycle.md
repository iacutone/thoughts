ATP is used for short-term energy storage used in cells.

ADP is a molecule which has 2 phosphate groups while ATP has 3 phosphate groups.

ATP has more energy than ADP and needs energy to add the phosphate--endergonic
When the energy (phosphate) is released the energy is released--exergonic
  -&gt; water is used to release the phosphate molecule--hydrolosis
